This is the set of source files for a talk at the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics
Conference at Stephen F Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX, on 18 October,
2014.

These slides are made using [Reveal.js]() v2.6.2. This is based on an earlier
presentation given at the Midwest Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium, 13 April 2013
at Simson College in Indianola, IA.

What is new represents work done by students in an undergraduate research project
I supervised as part of a Center for Undergraduate Research in Mathematics (CURM)
program. We thank the CURM for their generous support of this work.

Students:

- Ben Castle
- Jonathan Krein
- Jesse Moeller
- Abbie Parker

In particular, a few of the animations which appear here were made by Jesse Moeller.
